The data files contained in this folder represent behavioral data collected between July and December 2021, under the project "Role of the serotoninergic system in an animal model for panic disorder".
The behavioral data were collected by Bianca Gomes do Nascimento, under the supervision of Prof. Caio Maximino de Oliveira, at Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento (Unifesspa).
The data represent processed data for behavioral observations on adult zebrafish in an orienting response paradigm, described in the paper ["A model to study orienting responses in zebrafish, and applications towards the emotion–cognition interaction"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-020-01403-1). Animals were injected i.p. with either vehicle, the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor pCPA, or the serotonin precursor 5-HTP. Half of the animals were exposed to conspecific alarm substance. Animals were individually exposed to a screen which displayed, in 1 min intervals, a blue circle ("ON" trials), or a blank screen ("OFF trials").
Files are as follows:
* [orienting_pcpa_spatiotemporal.csv](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_pcpa_spatiotemporal.csv) is a comma-separated values-formatted table with data with animals treated with pCPA or vehicle, composed to spatiotemporal data (time spent near the stimulus, erratic swimming (absolute turn angle), and speed), separated by subject, drug status, treatment (water vs. CAS), trial, and trial type. These data were consolidated by automated tracking, using the software [TheRealFishtracker](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/FishTracker/).
* [orienting_pcpa_rproj.csv](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_pcpa_rproj.csv) is a comma-separated values-formatted table with data with animals treated with pCPA or vehicle, composed of body orientation data (projection vector *Rproj*, projection angle, and eye used to visualize the stimulus across trials). These data were consolidated by automated body orientation tracking software [FishTracker](https://github.com/joseaccruz/fishtracker)
* [orienting_5HTP_spatiotemporal.csv](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_5HTP_spatiotemporal.csv) is a CSV-formatted table with spatiotemporal data with animals treated with 5-HTP or vehicle, as above.
* [orienting_5HTP_rproj.csv](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_5HTP_rproj.csv) is a CSV-formatted table with body orientation data with animals treated with 5-HTP or vehicle, as above.
* [orienting_pcpa.R](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_pcpa.R) and [orienting_5HTP.R](https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/blob/master/orienting/orienting_5HTP.R) are R scripts with commands used for reproducing the data analysis and figures.
