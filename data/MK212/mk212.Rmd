  Behavioral data in the novel tank test during and after conspecific alarm substance (CAS) exposure  using MK-212 in zebrafish
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Data is produced by members from Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento "Frederico Guilherme Graeff", affiliated to Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará and Universidade do Estado do Pará. The package will include primary data for a behavioral experiment on the effects of MK-212 on zebrafish aggressive behavior. In Experiment 1, behavior during exposure was tested; in Experiment 2, behavior after exposure was tested.
