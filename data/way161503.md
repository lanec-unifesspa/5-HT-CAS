  Behavioral data in the novel tank test during and after conspecific alarm substance (CAS) exposure using WAY-163909 in zebrafish
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Data is produced by members from Laboratório de Neurociências e Comportamento "Frederico Guilherme Graeff", affiliated to Universidade Federal do Sul e Sudeste do Pará and Universidade do Estado do Pará. The package will include primary data for a behavioral experiment on the effects of WAY-163909 on zebrafish fear-like behavior. In Experiment 1, behavior during exposure was tested; in Experiment 2, behavior after exposure was tested.

* Load data

```{r}
x1 <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/master/data/WAY163909/way_during.csv")
way_during <- read.csv(text = x1)

* Detect outliers (based on time on bottom during exposure) and remove them, using a 3.5xMAD rule
```{r}
gA <- way_during[c(1:10), ]
median(gA$Time.Bottom) + 3.5*mad(gA$Time.Bottom)
median(gA$Time.Bottom) - 3.5*mad(gA$Time.Bottom)
#Subjects A2 and A16 identified as outlier; remove

gB <- way_during[c(11:20), ]
median(gB$Time.Bottom) + 3.5*mad(gB$Time.Bottom)
median(gB$Time.Bottom) - 3.5*mad(gB$Time.Bottom)

gC <- way_during[c(21:30), ]
median(gC$Time.Bottom) + 3.5*mad(gC$Time.Bottom)
median(gC$Time.Bottom) - 3.5*mad(gC$Time.Bottom)


gD <- way_during[c(31:39), ]
median(gD$Time.Bottom) + 3.5*mad(gD$Time.Bottom)
median(gD$Time.Bottom) - 3.5*mad(gD$Time.Bottom)
#No outliers
```
