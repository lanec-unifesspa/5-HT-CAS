The package will include primary data for a behavioral experiment on the effects of WAY-161503 on zebrafish fear-like behavior. In Experiment 1, behavior during exposure was tested; in Experiment 2, behavior after exposure was tested.
The package includes data (in csv format) for behavior during (way_during.csv) and after (way_after.csv) exposure, as well as RStudio notebooks in both md and Rmd formats.
